    <div class="feature-card1"><h1 class = "header1">What Is GreenSense?</h1>
        <p>GreenSense is a smart platform that helps small greenhouse farmers turn daily transactions into useful insights. Every time they buy supplies or sell crops, the system analyzes the data to show which crops earn the most, where expenses are too high, how much to plant next season, and which customers or markets are the most profitable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card2"><h2 class = "header2">How GreenSense Works</h2>
         <p>GreenSense is designed to be simple and farmer-friendly, making it easy to use even without technical skills. Farmers can quickly log all purchases and sales using a phone or computer, and the platform automatically analyzes these records to show profit per crop, cost per plant, and seasonal trends. It also sends helpful alerts when a crop underperforms, when expenses rise, or when a highly profitable crop should be planted more. To make everything easier to understand, GreenSense presents the information through clear charts and summaries, giving farmers straightforward and actionable insights without any complicated formulas.</p>

    <div class="feature-card3"><h3 class = "header3">Benefits of Using GreenSense</h3>
        <p>Using GreenSense offers several advantages for small greenhouse farmers. It helps them save money by showing exactly where their expenses go and which crops provide the highest returns. Farmers can reduce waste by avoiding overplanting and unnecessary purchases, while increasing profits through data-driven decisions about which crops to grow and which markets to focus on. GreenSense also improves planning by using past data to predict demand and optimize planting schedules. Overall, it provides peace of mind by monitoring transactions and delivering insights, allowing farmers to focus more on their actual farming.</p>

    <h2>Why GreenSense is Different?</h2>
    <p>Many tools available to farmers are either too complex or built for large industrial operations, while spreadsheets require manual, time-consuming work and traditional farm software is often costly and overwhelming for small growers. GreenSense stands out because it is designed specifically for small farms—easy to use, affordable, and focused on providing practical insights rather than just raw data. It uses AI to analyze trends in a smart but simple way, giving farmers useful information without needing to understand complicated technology.</p>
